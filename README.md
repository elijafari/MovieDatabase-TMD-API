# MovieDatabase-TMD-API
This Project is created by HTML,CSS, JavaScrip. It fetches movie lists with help of TMD API which is a free api and it include logo, nav bar and search button at head. 
At first I just create a simple movie list by adding three item that fetch image from unsplash to find the logic and also add the css file and then create the css to fetch data from TMD api.
